# Hotel-Booking-App

A comprehensive full-stack hotel booking and reservation application built from scratch using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). 

This project guides you through the complete process of developing a fully functional hotel reservation system. You'll build both the frontend and backend, implementing core features such as user authentication, booking logic, and calendar-based date selection.
